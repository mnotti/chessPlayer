todo:

- alpha/beta pruning (DONE)
- evaluation function:
	- prioritize moves checking pieces... and prioritizes checking higher point pieces
	- prioritize amount of possible moves by each piece...
	- prioritize center of the board...
- castling
(and tests)
- test en_passants
- make the depth a function of the amount of moves available on each level...
	e.g. > 30 moves (d = 3), > 20 (d = 4), > 10 (d = 5), > 5 (d = 6)
